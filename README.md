# node-firefox-examples-install-packaged

Simple example demonstrating how to install a packaged app to a Firefox OS simulator using [`node-firefox`](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox).

## Usage

Clone the repository, `cd` to its folder and run `npm install`. Then you can just run `node index.js` to get the app in the `app` folder deployed to a Firefox OS simulator (provided you have at least one installed!).
