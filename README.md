# build-and-deploy example

Simple example demonstrating how to prepare and deploy a packaged app to a Firefox OS simulator using `[fxos-deploy](https://github.com/nicola/fxos-deploy)`.

## Usage

Clone the repository, change to its folder and run `npm install`. Then you can just run `node index.js` to get the app in the `app` folder deployed to a Firefox OS simulator (provided you have one installed!).
